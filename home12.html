            <p>The discovery of Stone Age tools in the state indicates that the region had been inhabited since then. In the olden days, it included the current states of Tripura, West Bengal, and Assam’s Barak Valley, along with Bangladesh.</p>
            <p>By the 7th century AD, the present-day Bengal became a part of the Magadha Kingdom (one of the four major kingdoms in India) under the Mauryas and Guptas. By the 13th century, the region saw the emergence of Islamic power and from the mid-14th to end of 15th century it was under the reign of the Ilyas Shahi Dynasty.</p>
            <p>Bengal continued to be under the Muslim rule till the British in 1757 defeated the last sovereign Nawab of Bengal, Siraj ud-Daulah in the Battle of Plassey. Calcutta (Kolkata) became the capital of British India in 1772 and remained so till 1911. When India gained independence in 1947, Bengal was divided into two parts. While the western part became the state of West Bengal, the eastern part went to Pakistan and later became Bangladesh.</p>
