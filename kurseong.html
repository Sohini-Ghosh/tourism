            <h2>Kurseong Tourism</h2>
            <p>Also known as the 'Land of White Orchids', Kurseong is a hill station located close to Darjeeling famous for its waterfalls, temples and Buddhist gompas apart from the excellent view that the place provides.</p>
            <p>Perched on the Siliguri-Darjeeling highway, Kurseong is a quiet hill station. Kurseong enjoys milder and pleasant weather most times of the year. During the monsoon season the rain-gods are more than generous as the town receives non-stop rains for days. The rains are in fact much needed for the flora and fauna of the area. Kurseong, the 'Land of White Orchids', gets its name from the flowers found in abundance on its hill-slopes. It's difficult not to fall in love with the view of tea plantations, lush green forests in the panoramic setting of snow-clad mountains. At sunset, you can see an amalgamation of the most beautiful colors in the sky. You can see the British remnants in the form of churches and school in the town. This small hill-town makes for a great stopover for tourists looking for a more peaceful alternative to Darjeeling.</p>
