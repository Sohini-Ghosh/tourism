            <h2>Darjeeling Tourism</h2>
            <p>The previous summer capital of India under the British Raj, Darjeeling has come off age as one of the most sought after hill stations in India. Located in West Bengal, this scenic hill station is the perfect getaway for a romantic honeymoon. Nestled amidst acres of tea plantations, Darjeeling stands at the height of 2,050 meters above sea level, thus boasting a cool climate all year round.</p>
            <p>The toy train established back in 1881 is conferred the title of World Heritage Status by UNESCO. The train begins its journey from the plains and rises to over 2000 metres above sea level, offering breathtaking views of the mountains as it chugs along.</p>
            <p>Over 86 tea estates in Darjeeling are responsible for producing the worldwide famous 'Darjeeling Tea'. Have a cup of locally brewed chai at the tea estate, or get down amidst the plantations to pluck a few tea leaves yourself; you are free to take your pick!</p>
            <p>The third highest peak in the world and the highest in India, the Kanchenjunga peak, is visible from here, and you can enjoy a panoramic view of the peak. Some of Darjeeling's most popular attractions include monasteries, botanical gardens, a zoo, and the Darjeeling-Rangeet Valley Passenger Ropeway cable car, which is the longest Asian cable car. Tiger Hill is a fantastic spot to see the sunrise over the mountains in all its fiery glory. </p>

            <h2>Must Visit Places in Kalimpong</h2>
                <h3><u>Darjeeling Himalayan Railway</u></h3>
                <p>The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway also referred to as the DHR, and lovingly called the 'Darjeeling Toy Train', is a 2 feet narrow gauge train that runs between New Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling, in West Bengal, India. The construction of this 88-kilometre long railway line took place between 1879 and 1881, and a ride on this train route has been a coveted experience ever since. A journey in the Darjeeling Toy Train has amazing sights with pleasing mountain views and pass by villages and local shops on the way, with children merrily waving at them.</p>
                <p>The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway provides significant transport links between various parts of the Darjeeling hills and lower plains and is a piece of sheer engineering inventiveness and vision. How else can a small steam engine pull mini coaches up the steep mountains by overcoming almost unfeasible curves and gradients? This is perhaps why the Darjeeling Toy Train was declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site on 2 December 1999. Later on, two more railway lines were added, and the site came to be known as the Mountain Railways of India. A ride on such a heritage transport is no doubt a relaxing and charming one but is also prestigious because this train is what once provided the first and most important mountain transportation link in the country.</p>

                <h3><u>Batasia Loop</u></h3>
                <p>Perhaps one of the most picturesque train routes in all of Darjeeling, the Batasia Loop is a lush green toy train pathway that is meant to minimise the elevation of the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway. The unique design of this magnificent attraction allows the track to wrap around itself through a hilltop tunnel. One of the most enchanting aspects of the Batasia Loop is its unmatched natural beauty which is a wonderful sight to behold. Located on Hill Cart Road (NH 55), you can enjoy a panoramic view of the Darjeeling in all its verdant glory. </p>
                <p>Situated in Ghoom which is about 5 kilometres from Darjeeling, the motive behind creating the magnificent pathway of the Batasia Loop was rooted in easing navigation around the terrain of Darjeeling. It rises from the midst of emerald carpets of mountain vegetation and overlooks the snowy peaks of Kanchenjungha on one side as well. Endearing flowers line the way, which makes a trip through Batasia Loop a must after you have witnessed the fascinating sunrise of Tiger Hill. The view of the train tearing past the white of the clouds and deeper into the green beauty of the terrain is a refreshing and enchanting expedition which should not be missed.</p>

                <h3><u>Nightingale Park</u></h3>
                <p>Located in the mesmerising hill station of Darjeeling, the Nightingale Park is a public park area frequented by the tourists and locals to relish gorgeous views of the Kanchenjunga ranges. It serves as an ideal place to unwind and recharge amidst lush greenery and soothing winds. This park was earlier called 'The Shrubbery' when it was a private courtyard of Sir Thomas Tartan's Bungalow, during the British reign. Flanked by a covered archway, the entrance leads you to pebbled walkways around this oval-shaped park. Since the Nightingale Park is at a slighted elevated terrain, you need to climb a few steps to reach the entry to this green haven. The park was closed for renovation for about four years and has reopened for the public since 2011. There is a giant statue of Lord Shiva, a musical fountain along with the great scenery.</p>

            <h2>The Toy Train </h2>
            <p>The very famous toy train or the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, is one of the few hill railways still operating in India. The train passes through storefronts and weave its way through the main roads, bringing the traffic to a standstill. However, these stoppages only give you more time to soak in the mesmerising beauty and diverse culture of this lovely town. This train made its first journey in September 1881 and has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1999. There is a daily steam service to/from Kurseong and a diesel train service to/from NJP. The journey to/from NJP is an exhausting eight-hour haul, so you might want to consider the steam train to/from Kurseong. There are also two-hour joy-ride during the high season from Darjeeling. It stops for half an hour in Ghum which is India's highest railway station. Make sure to book at least a day ahead.</p>

                <h2>History of Darjeeling </h2>
                <p>History of Darjeeling 
                    The name Darjeeling means the "the land of the thunderbolt", derived from the Tibet word "Dorje" meaning "thunder" and "ling" meaning “piece of land”. Prior to its acquisition by East India Company, Darjeeling used to be a part of Sikkim and even before that, a part of Nepal. In February 1829, a dispute broke out between Nepal and Sikkim about their borders and hence, Lord William Bentinck- Governor General of India at the time, set out to resolve the situation. In the process, he realised that the quaint hill town had strategic advantages for trade and military outpost. Later, it was also realised that the land was ideal for tea plantations. The district underwent major development and became a major tourist attraction visited by the British officials. It, therefore, earned itself the title of "Queen of hills". After independence, the district was merged with West Bengal and since then is one of the most popular hill stations in India.</p>
